# Hangman - By Porter Schollenberger 
This is my version of the classic hangman game created in Python!

You can view the source code in ```hangman.py``` or go to ```dist/hangman.exe``` to run the code as an application! For those curious, the .exe file was created using PyInstaller.

This code is all original and uses two python libraries, those being ```random``` and ```os```. ```random``` was used for picking a random word to play with, and ```os``` was used to run the ```clear```/```cls``` terminal command to clean the screen of old text, making the game much more readable.

Please feel free to take a look at the source code to make sense of the process I took in creating this game. There you will find comments explaining most of the blocks of code I used!

The instructions given to me played a large part into the overall structure of the game, but I still took advantage of the freedoms I had to make the game look and feel like my own. I ensured everything was readable to my standards and that nothing was missing from the gameplay perspective. I ensured there was good error handling so the user doesn't get caught in a situation they didn't want to be in.

I spent just about 2 hours creating this project and had a lot of fun while doing so! Thanks for taking the time to check out my game!
